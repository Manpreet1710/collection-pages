Players have six chances to correctly guess a five-letter word chosen at random using Wordle. It turns green if you insert the proper letter in the proper location. The letter that should be there is highlighted in yellow. A letter that isn't in the word in any way appears grey. As experienced players are aware, a word with an incorrectly placed letter receives a yellow square. A green square is your reward for correctly inserting a letter into the word. Because you only have a limited number of guesses, the first word you enter is critical to getting the best results. A successful first guess should result in a few yellow squares, if not a green square. When you know very little about the secret solution, our word tool can come in handy.
